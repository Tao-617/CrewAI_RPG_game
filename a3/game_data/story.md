Dragon Slayer: The Rise of the Forgotten Kingdom

World-Building:
The game is set in the mystical realm of Eldoria, a once-prosperous kingdom now shrouded in darkness. Centuries ago, Eldoria was a land of magic and wonder, where humans and dragons coexisted in harmony. The kingdom was protected by the Order of Dragon Riders, an elite group of warriors who formed unbreakable bonds with their dragon companions.

However, 500 years before the game's events, a catastrophic event known as the Great Sundering occurred. A powerful dark mage named Malachar, consumed by jealousy and a thirst for power, unleashed an ancient evil upon the land. This malevolent force corrupted many dragons, turning them against their human allies. The ensuing war devastated Eldoria, leaving the kingdom in ruins and driving the remaining uncorrupted dragons into hiding.

In the present day, Eldoria is a shadow of its former self. The land is divided into struggling city-states, each barely holding out against the constant threat of corrupted dragons and other monstrous creatures that roam the wilderness. The once-great Order of Dragon Riders is now nothing more than a legend, and the art of dragon-taming has been lost to time.
