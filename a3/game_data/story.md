Lament of the Lost Gods: Game Storyline Document

1. World Overview:
The game is set in the world of Ethoria, a once-prosperous realm now teetering on the brink of destruction. Ethoria was created by five primordial gods who imbued the land with their essence, maintaining balance and harmony. However, a cataclysmic event known as the Sundering occurred 1,000 years ago, causing the gods to vanish and plunging Ethoria into chaos.

The world is divided into five distinct regions, each reflecting the domain of its patron god:
1. Solaria: The sun-blessed plains and golden cities (Light God)
2. Umbra: The shadow-veiled forests and hidden enclaves (Shadow God)
3. Tempestia: The storm-wracked coasts and floating islands (Storm God)

The player takes on the role of the Godslayer, a being of mysterious origin awakened after a thousand-year slumber. As the Godslayer regains consciousness, they discover that Ethoria is plagued by corruption, with monstrous beings called the Void-Touched threatening to consume all of existence.

The main quest of the Godslayer is to restore balance to Ethoria by seeking out the essences of the lost gods, which have been scattered across the land. By collecting these essences, the Godslayer can rekindle the power of the gods and push back the encroaching Void.

However, as the Godslayer progresses on their journey, they uncover a shocking truth: the gods themselves were responsible for the Sundering, having grown corrupt and power-hungry.
