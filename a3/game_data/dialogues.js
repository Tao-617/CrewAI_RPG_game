    intro: [
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Where... where am I? These memories... they're not mine, are they?" },
        { speaker: 'lyra', text: "You've awakened at last, Godslayer. Ethoria has been waiting for you." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Godslayer? Ethoria? I don't understand..." },
        { speaker: 'lyra', text: "The void encroaches, and the essence of the lost gods calls out to you. Your journey begins now." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Lost gods? Void? Please, I need answers!" },
        { speaker: 'lyra', text: "All will be revealed in time. For now, know that you alone have the power to restore balance to our world." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "I... I'm not sure I'm ready for this." },
        { speaker: 'lyra', text: "Ready or not, Ethoria needs you. The path ahead is fraught with danger, but also with great purpose." }
    ],
    meetKarzak: [
        { speaker: 'karzak', text: "Stand back! Another step and you'll regret it, stranger." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Easy there. I'm not your enemy. I'm seeking to push back the Void." },
        { speaker: 'karzak', text: "The Void, eh? And what would you know about that?" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Not much, I admit. But I have the power to absorb divine essence. I'm here to help." },
        { speaker: 'karzak', text: "Divine essence? Hah! That's what got us into this mess in the first place." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "What do you mean?" },
        { speaker: 'karzak', text: "The gods... they're not as benevolent as you might think. But if you're serious about fighting the Void, you'll need all the help you can get." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Then will you join me? Your experience could be invaluable." },
        { speaker: 'karzak', text: "...Fine. But don't expect me to trust you just yet. And if you start showing signs of corruption, I won't hesitate." }
    ],
    meetElara: [
        { speaker: 'elara', text: "Fascinating! The divine essence within you... it's unlike anything I've ever seen!" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Who are you? How can you see the essence?" },
        { speaker: 'elara', text: "I'm Elara, the Essence Weaver. And you, my dear, are a walking miracle of metaphysical energy!" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "I'm told I can use this power to save Ethoria. Can you help me understand it?" },
        { speaker: 'elara', text: "Oh, I can do much more than that. I can help you harness it, shape it into artifacts of immense power!" },
        { speaker: 'karzak', text: "Careful, Godslayer. Power like that always comes with a price." },
        { speaker: 'elara', text: "Don't mind him. Think of the good we could do, the Void we could push back!" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "I... I need to think about this. The power is tempting, but I'm not sure I'm ready for it." }
    ],
    midBattle: [
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "So, the so-called Godslayer graces us with their presence. How disappointing." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Malachar! Your reign of terror ends here!" },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "Terror? I offer salvation! The Void is the only true path to remake this corrupted world." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "By destroying everything? That's not salvation, it's annihilation!" },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "You understand nothing! The gods you seek to restore are the true villains here." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "What are you talking about?" },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "Ask yourself, why did the gods vanish? What caused the Sundering? The truth will shake your very core!" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Whatever the truth is, it doesn't justify the suffering you've caused!" },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "Then come, 'hero'. Let us see if your stolen divine power can match the true strength of the Void!" }
    ],
    finalBattle: [
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "Still you persist? Your stubbornness is admirable, if futile." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "I've seen the truth, Malachar. About the gods, about you. But this isn't the way!" },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "And what way would you propose? To resurrect the very beings that brought ruin to Ethoria?" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "No. To forge a new path, one that doesn't rely on gods or void, but on the strength of Ethoria itself!" },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "Naive fool! The cycle will only repeat itself. The Void is the only constant, the only truth!" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "You're wrong. We make our own truth, our own future. And I'll prove it here and now!" },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "Then come, Godslayer. Show me this 'truth' of yours, if you can pierce the darkness of reality!" }
    ],
    lose: [
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "And so falls the last hope of Ethoria. How utterly predictable." },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "The Void will consume all, and from its depths, a new, perfect world will emerge." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "No... Ethoria... I'm sorry... I wasn't... strong enough..." },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "Hush now, and embrace the coming darkness. It's over, Godslayer. The Void reigns supreme." }
    ],
    win: [
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "It's done. The Void... it's receding." },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "Impossible... How could you overcome the power of the Void?" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "Because I didn't fight alone. The essence of Ethoria itself stood with me." },
        { speaker: 'malachar', text: "You fool... Do you think this changes anything? The cycle will begin anew!" },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "No, it won't. We've learned from the past, from your mistakes and the gods'. We'll do better." },
        { speaker: 'lyra', text: "The prophecy is fulfilled, but your journey is far from over, Godslayer." },
        { speaker: 'godslayer', text: "You're right, Lyra. This isn't an end, but a new beginning. For all of Ethoria." }
