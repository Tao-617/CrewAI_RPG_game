        { speaker: 'Eldrin', text: "Aria, my child! We must flee. A corrupted dragon attacks!" },
        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "But our home, our people—we can't just leave them!" },
        { speaker: 'Eldrin', text: "There's no time. Your destiny is too important." },
        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "Destiny? What are you talking about?" },

        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "Stop! Please, don't hurt us!" },
        { speaker: 'Narrator', text: "To Aria's shock, the dragon hesitates, confusion in its eyes." },
        { speaker: 'Eldrin', text: "By the ancients... Aria, you're communicating with it!" },
        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "I... I don't understand. How am I doing this?" },
        { speaker: 'Eldrin', text: "The blood of the Dragon Riders flows in your veins. It's time you learned the truth." }

    eldoriaRuins: [
        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "These ruins... they're magnificent. What happened here?" },
        { speaker: 'Cyrus', text: "The Great Sundering. At least, that's what the legends say." },
        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "You don't believe in the legends?" },
        { speaker: 'Cyrus', text: "I believe in what I can see and touch. Legends are just stories." },
        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "But look at these carvings. Dragons and humans, working together." },
        { speaker: 'Cyrus', text: "Fairy tales. Dragons are monsters, nothing more." },
        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "I'm not so sure. There's something here, something... familiar." },
        { speaker: 'Cyrus', text: "Careful, Aria. Don't let your imagination run wild." },
        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "It's not imagination. I can feel it. The history here, it's... alive." }

        { speaker: 'Lyra', text: "And I am Lyra, of the Arcane Academy." },

        { speaker: 'Aria', text: "A common purpose. To save Eldoria from the corrupted dragons." },
        { speaker: 'Guard', text: "Bold words. But Ironhold has heard such claims before." },
        { speaker: 'Lyra', text: "Perhaps. But has Ironhold ever seen this?" },
