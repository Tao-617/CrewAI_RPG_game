Code Style Characteristics
Modular Design:

Organized into modules: Player, EnemyManager, DialogueSystem, Background, and HUD.

GameLogic serves as the central controller, responsible for orchestrating updates across all subsystems.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

All core entities (player, enemies, dialogues, background) are instantiated as classes for better encapsulation and reusability.

Clear Organization:

Separation of responsibilities for update cycles, collision detection, UI updates, audio playback, and game state management.

✨ Core Functional Highlights
Game Loop:

The update() method refreshes each frame.

Execution order: clear canvas → update background → update player → update enemies → handle projectiles → detect collisions → update HUD → trigger dialogues.

Input Control:

Keyboard bindings:

A/D: Move left/right

K: Jump

J: Attack

Enter: Advance dialogue

Collision Detection:

Projectiles colliding with enemies.

Enemy projectiles colliding with the player.

Integrated Dialogue System:

Pauses gameplay at key story moments to display dialogues via the DialogueSystem.

Score and Victory/Defeat Conditions:

Reaching maximum score triggers victory.

Health reaching zero triggers player death.

Local Storage:

localStorage is used to save and compare high scores across game sessions.

Dynamic UI Management:

Real-time HUD updates for health, score, and distance.

Dynamically generated "You Win" or "Game Over" screens upon end conditions.

✨ Technical Style
ES6+ Syntax:

Extensive use of modern JavaScript features such as class, import/export, and arrow functions.

Canvas 2D API:

Native canvas drawing used for rendering gameplay scenes and UI elements.

Responsive Canvas Scaling:

Canvas dimensions dynamically set to window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight for full-screen support.

Simplified Event Debouncing:

Use of setTimeout() for delayed UI actions (e.g., restart buttons).

Error Handling and Safety:

Ensures clamping of health values using Math.max and Math.min.

Proper dynamic removal of projectiles and enemies when off-screen or defeated.
