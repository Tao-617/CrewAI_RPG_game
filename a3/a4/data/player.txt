 Code Style Characteristics
Modular Design:

A standalone Player class manages player movement, actions, and rendering.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Player attributes and behaviors (movement, jumping, attacking) are encapsulated cleanly within the class structure.

Native Canvas Drawing:

Uses drawImage() for sprite animation rendering.

Uses fillRect() and arc() for simple elements like health bars and projectiles.

✨ Core Functional Highlights
Movement and Jumping:

A/D keys for left/right movement.

K key for jumping, with basic gravity simulation (velocityY + gravity).

Animation Handling:

4-frame looped spritesheet animation controlled by frameCounter and frameSpeed.

Animation resets to the first frame when idle.

Supports mirrored rendering using ctx.scale(-1, 1) for left/right facing.

Attacks and Projectiles:

J key triggers an attack, firing a blue circular projectile.

Projectiles move forward and are automatically removed when off-screen.

Health Bar Display:

A red health bar is drawn above the player, dynamically scaling with health percentage.

Score Tracking:

score attribute is updated, and score rendering (drawScore()) is separated from the main updatePlayer() logic.

✨ Technical Details
Responsive Sizing:

Player size, position, movement speed, and gravity are all relative to canvas.width and canvas.height for device adaptability.

Mirroring Technique:

Uses ctx.save() and ctx.restore() to isolate flipped drawing, preventing unwanted global canvas transformations.

Performance Considerations:

Simple and efficient rendering for projectiles and health bars.

Automatic cleanup of projectiles once they exit the visible screen area.
