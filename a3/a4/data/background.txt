„ÄêNew Background.js Module Summary„Äë
üîµ Core Style Changes

No longer using the Drawer component to manually draw background elements.

Each scene now corresponds to a full background image.

Backgrounds are dynamically switched and directly drawn onto the canvas.

The object movement logic (e.g., clouds, trees) remains if needed for parallax effects.

üîµ Core Functional Description

Initialization:

The Background class preloads all scene-specific background images using <img> elements.

Background Switching:

The switchBackground(scene) method updates the current background image reference without reloading from disk.

Drawing Background:

The drawBackground() method draws the active background image to fully cover the canvas.

Backgrounds are stretched or scaled adaptively:
(ctx.drawImage(image, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)).

Moving Static Objects:

moveObjects(logic) is retained to handle horizontal movement of clouds, grass, trees, etc., for added parallax if desired.

üîµ Technical Requirements

Image Preloading:

Each scene uses a dedicated Image object preloaded during initialization.

Scene Name to Image Mapping:

Scene names map to image filenames, e.g., verdantHeartlands ‚Üí images/backgrounds/verdant_heartlands.png.

Efficient Switching:

Switching backgrounds only changes the active reference ‚Äî no repeated network loading.

Responsive Drawing:

Background images are rendered considering different screen sizes and aspect ratios.

Default Scene:

Starts with verdantHeartlands as the initial background.
