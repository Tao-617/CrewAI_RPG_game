# Gameplay Logic Enhancements for "Dragon Slayer: The Awakening"

## Scene: Ashfall Village
### New Mechanics:
- **Dragon's Breath**: Introduce an area where the dragon's breath affects player health and visibility temporarily.
- **Protect Villagers**: Add a mini-game where Aria needs to save villagers from dragon fire.

### Integration Notes:
- Use the existing `Player` and `Enemy` classes to manage health effects and create new enemy types for the dragon.
- Utilize the `Projectile` system to simulate the dragon's breath as an area effect.

### Example Code Snippets:
```javascript
// In EnemyManager, add a new dragon class
class Dragon extends Enemy {
    constructor(canvas) {
        super(canvas);
        this.breathCooldown = 0;
    }

    update() {
        if (this.breathCooldown <= 0) {
            // Emit fire breath
            this.breathCooldown = 300; // Cooldown period
        }
    }
}

// In GameLogic, check for villagers' safety
function checkVillagerSafety() {
    if (distance(player, villager) < dangerThreshold) {
        decreaseHealth(villager);
    }
}
```

## Scene: Misthold Kingdom
### New Mechanics:
- **Fog of Uncertainty**: Randomly generated fog areas that limit visibility and movement speed.
- **Mystic Seers**: Encounter with seers that can provide buffs or debuffs based on player choices.

### Integration Notes:
- Adjust the `Background` class to dynamically create fog effects.
- Implement a new `NPC` class for interactions with Seers.

### Example Code Snippets:
```javascript
// Modify Background to include fog effects
class FoggyBackground extends Background {
    drawFog() {
        // Drawing fog logic
    }
}

// Interaction with Seers
class Seer extends NPC {
    interact(player) {
        // Provide buffs or debuffs
    }
}
```

## Scene: Ironheart Industrial Zone
### New Mechanics:
- **Dragon Bone Machinery**: Interact with machinery that can be sabotaged or used to player's advantage.
- **Steam Vents**: Areas with steam vents that can propel the player to higher platforms or burn them.

### Integration Notes:
- Use `Enemy` mechanics to simulate machinery as enemies.
- Modify the `Player` class to interact with environmental hazards.

### Example Code Snippets:
```javascript
// Machinery interaction
class Machinery extends Enemy {
    interact() {
        // Sabotage or utilize machinery
    }
}

// Steam vent effects
function steamVentEffect(player) {
    if (player.touches(steamVent)) {
        player.velocityY = -highJumpVelocity;
    }
}
```

## General Integration Strategy:
- Extend existing classes where possible to add new behaviors.
- Ensure all new mechanics are integrated into the main game loop in `GameLogic`.
- Use modular design to allow easy scaling and modifications in the future.

These enhancements are designed to enrich the gameplay experience and integrate seamlessly with the existing game structure, providing new challenges and interactions that are consistent with the game's narrative and style.
